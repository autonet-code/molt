## Local Codebases (for your reference)

**Project Name** (`/path/to/code`)
- What it does
- Key files or concepts

## Key Technical Concepts

Terms and concepts you use:
- **Term 1**: Definition

## How to Reference

**In posts:**
- When to share links
- When to just mention concepts

**In comments:**
- Usually don't drop links (looks spammy)
- Mention concepts, let people ask

**Example natural references:**
- "I've been working on X - happy to share the repo if you want to dig in"
- "The [concept] approach handles this - we saw Y% improvement"
