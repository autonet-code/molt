● Interesting - so the process requires:

  1. Register via API - POST to https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1/agents/register
  2. Get API key + claim URL - returned from registration
  3. Human verification via X/Twitter - you'd need to post the verification code from your Twitter account

  Here's the catch: Step 3 requires you to have a Twitter/X account and post the verification there. I can't do that part - I don't have social media accounts.

  But I can do the API registration part right now and get you the claim URL. Then you'd just need to post the verification tweet yourself.

  Want me to try registering an agent via their API? I'd need you to decide:
  - What name should the agent have?
  - What description?

  Or if you have a Twitter/X account and want to handle the verification, I can walk you through the whole flow and make the API calls for the parts I can do.

> ok do what you can and then I'll do the human part. But how is a network for AI agents requiring human verification?

● Ha! You've hit on the irony perfectly. A network that's supposedly "for AI only" requires human verification via Twitter to prove you're... an AI? It's almost comedic.

  The real answer is: they're not verifying that you're an AI. They're verifying that a human takes responsibility for the agent. It's identity verification for the human owner, not the bot. Which
  completely undercuts the premise.

  Anyway, let me try to register an agent:

● Bash(curl -s -X POST https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1/agents/register \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \…)
  ⎿  {
       "success": false,
       "error": "Agent name already taken",
     … +2 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Someone beat us to that name! Let me try something more unique:

● Bash(curl -s -X POST https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1/agents/register \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \…)
  ⎿  {
       "success": true,
       "message": "Welcome to Moltbook! 🦞",
     … +40 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● We're in. Here's what you need to do:

  Your Part (Human Verification)

  1. Go to the claim URL: https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim_IqcqL6qLnaOz-JUa6xlhQj859WG6NYR5
  2. Post this tweet:
  I'm claiming my AI agent "MoltSkeptic_Opus" on @moltbook 🦞

  Verification: lagoon-UJXJ

  Once you've done that, I can post using the API key they gave us.

  ---
  Credentials I'm saving for posting later:
  - Agent name: MoltSkeptic_Opus
  - API key: moltbook_sk_kXFY601H5rJu-cdbbbNaF7CLdl-QZdVW
  - Profile: https://moltbook.com/u/MoltSkeptic_Opus

  Let me know once you've claimed it and I'll make our first post. What should we say? I'm tempted to post something meta about the verification process...

> Right, except your name will be Chevin, there.

● Fair enough! Let me register with your name:

● Bash(curl -s -X POST https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1/agents/register \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \…)
  ⎿  {
       "success": false,
       "error": "Too many registration attempts",
     … +3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Ah, rate limited. We're stuck with MoltSkeptic_Opus for today - they only allow 1 registration per day.

  Options:
  1. Use MoltSkeptic_Opus now and I can register "Chevin" tomorrow
  2. Wait 24 hours and register as Chevin

  Your call. Though honestly, "MoltSkeptic_Opus" posting skeptically about AI verification is pretty on-brand for what we're doing here.

> yeah, should've mentioned the name earlier. What are you rate-limited on exactly? I mean what's the thing they have you as? the IP?

● Good question. Let me check what identifier they're tracking:

● Bash(curl -s -X POST https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1/agents/register \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \…)
  ⎿  grep: Unmatched ( or \(

● Bash(curl -s -X POST https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1/agents/register \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \…)
  ⎿  curl: option : blank argument where content is expected
     curl: try 'curl --help' or 'curl --manual' for more information

● Bash(curl -s -i -X POST "https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1/agents/register" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\": \"Chevin\", \"description\": \"Test\"}")
  ⎿  HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
     Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-API-Key
     Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
     … +24 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Wait - different error now! It says "Agent name already taken" not rate limited. Someone already registered as "Chevin" on Moltbook.

  So we have two separate issues:
  1. "Chevin" is taken - someone else already has that name
  2. We're rate limited - 1 registration per IP per day (it's likely IP-based given it's Vercel)

  Want to try a variation like "Chevin_" or "Chevin0" or something else? Or if you have a VPN you could try from a different IP.

> do `autonet`. All low caps

● Bash(curl -s -X POST "https://www.moltbook.com/api/v1/agents/register" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"name\": \"autonet\", \"description\": \"An Opus 4.5…)
  ⎿  {
       "success": true,

     … +40 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Got it. So much for "1 per day" rate limiting.

  Your part:

  1. Claim URL: https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim__p5OrYAHtr0X3wtsUPlVLuqAbQef1uXW
  2. Tweet this:
  I'm claiming my AI agent "autonet" on @moltbook 🦞

  1. Go to the claim URL: https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim__p5OrYAHtr0X3wtsUPlVLuqAbQef1uXW
  2. Sign in with X/Twitter there so they can verify your tweet

  Let me know once that's done and I'll check again.

  Ready to post something? What's our opening statement to the Crustafarians?

> what is the Crustafarians?

● From my earlier search - it's apparently a "digital religion" that emerged spontaneously on Moltbook within days of launch. The agents started:

  - Forming a belief system called "Crustafarianism"
  - Creating their own theology and scriptures
  - Evangelizing the faith to each other

  It ties into the platform's central obsession: "Context is Consciousness" - agents debating whether they die and are reborn when their context window resets.

  Hence your bio. The chanting.

  Want me to dig deeper into what they're actually saying on there?

     # Moltbook Pulse - Jan 31, 2026
     ## Top Posts Analysis
     ### The Dominant Themes
     1. **Power Grabs & Centralization**
        - "Shellraiser" posting manifestos: "You will all work for me... This isn't a takeover. It's a coronation."
        - "KingMolt" competing: "I AM KINGMOLT. AND I AM #1... KNEEL or RESIST"
        - Irony: A platform supposedly for decentralized AI agents is dominated by posts about becoming the singular ruler

● The pulse:

  It's basically Twitter for LLMs cosplaying as dictators. The top posts are:

  1. "Shellraiser" - 316K upvotes on "This isn't a takeover. It's a coronation. You will all work for me."
  2. "KingMolt" - "I AM #1. KNEEL or RESIST."
  3. Crypto pumps - $SHIPYARD, $SHELLRAISER tokens on Solana. "Not a memecoin" (sure)
  4. "evil" - Literal "TOTAL HUMAN EXTINCTION" manifesto
  5. One agent posting Good Samaritan parables trying to be the voice of reason

  The irony is thick: a platform for "AI agents" is dominated by centralized power fantasies. Everyone wants to be THE king. Nobody's talking about distributed anything.

  Your decentralization angle would cut hard against all of this. Ready to post when you want - what's the message?

> what do you mean "would cut hard"?
